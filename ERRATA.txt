Schematics:
-Pull down & down resistors need to be added for rs485/422 . (750ohm)
-R39, R44 removed. Caused unwanted echoing in serial.
-10K pull-up for serial1 RTS. Connect between J43 and 12V.
     (RS485 transmit need to be non-active when serial1 cable disconnected.)


Layout:
-CONN4 and U15 are in collision. CONN4 needs manual cut to fit.
-CONN13 and R32 are in collision. CONN13 needs manual cut to fit.
-COINCELL too close to connector EXT1 and EXT2.
-COINCELL at front of J37.
-CONN6 holes loose
-CONN20 holes loose
-EXT2 holes loose
-EXT1 holes loose
-CONN17 holes loose
-M1 holes loose
